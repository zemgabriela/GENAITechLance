While our PPO and HDHP plans do provide some coverage for out-of-network care, the HMO plan only covers out-of-network services in emergency situations. If you choose to see an out-of-network provider, you may need to pay the full amount upfront and then submit claims to the insurance company for reimbursement.\\n\\nIt&#x27;s important to verify that a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment, as networks can change.
