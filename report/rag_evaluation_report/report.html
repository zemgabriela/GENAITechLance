If you have a gym or fitness center that&#x27;s convenient to your home or work, let us know! We regularly review and consider employee suggestions for new partnerships. Please note that while we strive to accommodate requests, individual facility terms and conditions will apply to all memberships. This policy is effective immediately and may change as we update our partnerships and benefit offerings, but we will provide appropriate notice about any modifications.","If you decide to leave Techlance, your gym membership through the company will typically end as well. This is part of our fitness benefits, which are designed to support employees while they are with us. Once you leave the company, you would lose access to the gym facilities and any associated programs. If you&#x27;re planning on transitioning out, it&#x27;s a good idea to check with HR to understand all the specifics regarding your benefits and options that may be available to you post-employment.","At Techlance, we provide several fitness benefits designed to help you and your family stay active and healthy. Here\\u2019s a breakdown of what\\u2019s available:\\n\\n1. **Discounted Gym Memberships**: We have partnered with a variety of fitness centers to offer significant discounts on gym memberships. These partnerships are categorized into three tiers based on the level of discount and services provided:\\n   - **Tier 1 Partners**: Enjoy the best savings, with up to 50% off regular membership rates. This includes well-known chains like 24 Hour Fitness, LA Fitness, Planet Fitness, as well as select local community centers. These gyms typically offer access to gym equipment, group classes, and standard fitness services. \\n\\n2. **Fitness Reimbursement**: We also support your investment in your health with reimbursement programs for fitness equipment and technology. This means if you purchase items like weights, yoga mats, or fitness tracking devices, you may be eligible to get some of your money back!\\n\\n3. **Encouraging Health and Wellness**: We highly encourage all employees to utilize these benefits. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important not just for your personal well-being but also enhances your productivity and success at work.\\n\\nTake advantage of these offerings and find options that suit your interests and fitness levels!","Employees will receive 30 days&#x27; notice before any significant changes are made to childcare benefits. If you have specific questions or need to discuss your childcare needs, feel free to reach out to HR at hr@techlance.com or set up a meeting with our family services coordinator. Please note that this policy is effective immediately and may change based on business needs or legal requirements.","Our wellness program is designed to promote your health while also providing financial benefits through HSA contributions and health insurance premium credits. Here\\u2019s a breakdown of what you can earn:\\n\\n1. **Total Potential Earnings**: You can earn up to $300 each year.\\n2. **Biometric Screening**: Complete an annual biometric screening to earn $100.\\n3. **Health Assessment**: Finish a health assessment for an additional $50.\\n4. **Wellness Challenges**: Participate in various wellness challenges throughout the year to earn up to $150.\\n\\nAdditionally, after you turn 65, you can use your HSA funds for any purpose without penalties (though non-medical withdrawals will be subject to income tax), making the HSA a useful tool for retirement savings.\\n\\nAll employees also have access to free telemedicine services, available 24/7 for non-emergency medical issues. This can save you time and often allows you to get prescriptions without needing to visit a doctor in person.","Here&#x27;s a friendly summary of the reimbursement policy and security requirements for remote workers:\\n\\n**Remote Work Reimbursements:**\\n- **Internet Service:** You can get reimbursed up to $75 each month for your internet costs. Just remember to submit a receipt for the reimbursement.\\n- **Mobile Phone:** If you use your phone for work, we\\u2019ll cover up to $50 monthly for the business-related portion of your mobile phone bill.\\n- **Home Office Furnishings:** You have a $500 allowance each year to spend on home office furniture and improvements.\\n- **Productivity Software:** There\\u2019s an additional $200 annually for productivity software and peripherals you might need.\\n\\n**Security and Technology Requirements:**\\n- **Cybersecurity:** It&#x27;s really important to protect company and client data. All remote workers must:\\n  - Use the company VPN for any work-related tasks.\\n  - Keep password managers up to date for business accounts.\\n  - Enable two-factor authentication on all business systems.\\n  - Ensure your devices have the latest security updates.\\n- **Wi-Fi Security:** Your home Wi-Fi should use WPA3 encryption or the highest security level your router supports.\\n- **File Storage:** Make sure to store all work files in approved cloud services instead of on personal devices. Don\\u2019t keep any confidential company information on your personal devices.\\n\\nIf you have questions about any of these points, feel free to ask!","At Techlance, you have access to a lifetime maximum benefit of $25,000 for employee education during your entire career with the company. This includes:\\n\\n- Up to **$3,000 per year** for degree programs.\\n- Up to **$2,000 annually** for individual courses that are not part of a degree program.\\n\\nThese limits apply separately to undergraduate and graduate studies, and they do not reset if you get promoted or change roles. \\n\\nIn special cases, like when you&#x27;re in your final semester and may exceed these annual limits, we may provide extra support to help you complete your degree requirements. Keep in mind that any expenses beyond the maximums will be your responsibility. \\n\\nTo take advantage of these benefits, you need to complete the application process at least **30 days before** your course starts. This allows enough time for us to review and approve your request. Make sure to plan your educational timeline well to maximize these benefits!","If your primary beneficiary passes away before you, it\\u2019s important to have a backup plan. To ensure your insurance benefits go to someone, consider naming contingent beneficiaries \\u2014 these are secondary individuals who will receive the proceeds if your primary beneficiaries are no longer available. Without them, the insurance money could go to your estate, which can lead to tax issues and delays for your loved ones.\\n\\nIt&#x27;s a good practice to regularly check and update your beneficiaries, especially during important life changes like marriage, divorce, the birth or adoption of children, or the death of a previously named beneficiary. You can easily make these updates anytime through our online benefits portal, and changes will take effect immediately upon submission.\\n\\nIn case you need to file a claim, reach out to the insurance company or Techlance HR promptly. Typically, you&#x27;ll need to provide a certified death certificate, fill out claim forms, and show identification. Most claims are processed within 30 days, as long as all necessary documents are submitted.","If you decide to leave Techlance before completing your service commitment, you will need to repay a portion of any reimbursement you received, based on how long you&#x27;ve been with the company after that reimbursement. Here&#x27;s how it works:\\n\\n- **First 6 months after reimbursement**: You repay 100%.\\n- **6 to 12 months after reimbursement**: You repay 75%.\\n- **12 to 18 months after reimbursement**: You repay 50%.\\n- **18 to 24 months after reimbursement**: You repay 25%.\\n\\nThere are some exceptions where you wouldn&#x27;t have to repay, such as if you were involuntarily terminated without cause, if there were layoffs, or if you faced serious medical hardships.\\n\\nIf necessary, the company may seek legal action to collect unpaid amounts, but typically, Techlance will try to work with you to arrange a reasonable payment plan for larger sums. \\n\\nKeep in mind that we encourage pursuing education on a part-time basis during employment, and there may be options for educational leave or sabbaticals.","**Techlance Childcare Support Overview**\\n\\nAt Techlance, we recognize that juggling work with family duties, especially for those with young children, can be challenging.

You can expect to pay around **$10 for a 30-day supply** of these medications.\\n\\n- **Brand-name and Specialty Medications**: These medications generally have higher copays or may require coinsurance, meaning you pay a percentage of the cost instead of a fixed amount.\\n\\n- **Mail-Order Pharmacy**: If you use mail-order services, you can save even more money by getting a **90-day supply** of your maintenance medications.\\n\\n- **Understanding Your Benefits**:\\n  - **Copays**: These are fixed amounts you&#x27;ll pay for specific services. For example, it might be **$25 for a primary care visit**.\\n  - **Coinsurance**: This is when you pay a percentage of the total cost after meeting your deductible. For instance, if it\\u2019s **20% for hospital stays**, you would pay 20% of the bill after your deductible is met.\\n  - **Annual Deductible**: This is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance contributes to most services. However, some preventive care services are covered before you meet your deductible.\\n\\nUnderstanding these terms will help you make the most of your health benefits!","To participate in our programs, including those for children aged six weeks to 12 years and some summer camps for up to 14 years, it&#x27;s important to ensure that your child meets specific immunization requirements.

The total coverage (including any basic life insurance you have) can\\u2019t exceed five times your annual salary or $1,000,000, whichever is lower.\\n\\n- **Cost Calculation**: The premium for supplemental life insurance is calculated based on your age and tobacco use, with costs measured per $1,000 of coverage. For someone who is 35 years old and doesn\\u2019t smoke, the monthly cost is approximately $0.12 for every $1,000 of coverage.\\n\\n- **Example Premium**: If you want $100,000 in supplemental life insurance, the calculation would be:\\n    - $100,000 coverage \\u00f7 $1,000 = 100\\n    - 100 x $0.12 = $12 per month.\\n\\nSo, your monthly premium for $100,000 of supplemental life insurance would be around **$12**. \\n\\nRemember that rates will increase as you age, and if you use tobacco, rates are typically much higher. For coverage amounts up to $150,000, no additional health screening is required.","If you&#x27;re planning to take a vacation for three to four days, please give at least **two weeks&#x27; advance notice**.

Importantly, the HDHP uses the same provider network as our PPO plan, giving you flexibility in choosing your healthcare providers after meeting the deductible. \\n\\nTo give you a broader comparison, the monthly premiums for other coverage options are as follows:\\n- PPO plan: $89\\n- HMO plan: $45\\n\\nThese contributions amount to only part of the total premium costs, with the company subsidizing the majority of your health insurance expenses. Premium contributions are reviewed annually to maintain competitiveness.","If you contribute more than the allowed annual limits to your retirement plan, here\\u2019s what you need to know:\\n\\n1. **Automatic Stopping**: Contributions will automatically stop once you reach the annual limit, preventing any further contributions for that year.\\n\\n2. **Excess Contributions**: If you do happen to exceed the limit, you must withdraw the excess funds. \\n\\n3. **Possible Penalties**: Withdrawing excess contributions may come with penalties, as outlined by IRS regulations.\\n\\n4. **Effective Immediately**: This policy is in effect right away and replaces any previous retirement plan policies you may be familiar with.\\n\\n5. **Regulatory Compliance**: All provisions of the plan follow IRS regulations and the terms of the plan document.

This repayment is calculated on a prorated basis based on when you leave.\\n\\n2. **Repayment Breakdown**:\\n   - If you leave within the first 6 months after receiving the reimbursement: repay **100%**\\n   - If you leave between 6-12 months: repay **75%**\\n   - If you leave between 12-18 months: repay **50%**\\n   - If you leave between 18-24 months: repay **25%**\\n\\n3. **Exceptions**: You won\\u2019t have to repay if you\\u2019re terminated involuntarily without cause, if there are workforce reductions or layoffs, if you experience serious medical hardships, or if Techlance eliminates your position/location.\\n\\n4. **Collection of Unpaid Balances**: While the company can pursue legal action for unpaid amounts, it usually prefers to work with employees to set up reasonable payment plans, especially for larger debts.\\n\\nRemember, this policy is meant to ensure that employees uphold their commitments while offering some flexibility in certain circumstances.","In our 401(k) plan, we offer target-date funds that simplify your investment strategy for retirement savings, especially if your work situation changes or your performance declines while working remotely. \\n\\nThese funds are designed to grow your savings over time without needing constant monitoring. They cater to a variety of investment preferences and risk levels, offering a diverse range of options while keeping costs low.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s how target-date funds work:\\n\\n- **Automatic Adjustment**: Each fund is named for an approximate retirement year (like 2030, 2040, etc.). As you age and approach retirement, the fund automatically adjusts your investment mix. It starts with a higher investment in stocks when you\\u2019re younger, which has the potential for higher returns, and gradually shifts towards more stable investments like bonds as you get closer to retirement. This helps protect your savings from market downturns later on.\\n\\n- **Less Stress**: You don\\u2019t have to make frequent decisions about how to allocate your investments\\u2014these funds do that for you, making retirement saving easier and more efficient. Research shows that employees who participate in automatic enrollment and escalation in their 401(k) often save significantly more than those who don\\u2019t, leading to better retirement wealth overall.\\n\\nIn summary, target-date funds are a great option within our 401(k) plan, helping you to accumulate savings effectively and adjust automatically to protect your retirement investments over time.","Understanding your healthcare benefits is crucial, especially when it comes to knowing the difference between in-network and out-of-network providers:\\n\\n**In-Network Providers:** \\n- These are healthcare providers who have contracts with your insurance company to provide services at negotiated rates. Using in-network providers generally means lower out-of-pocket costs for you. This can include lower deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. It\\u2019s a more affordable option for accessing care.\\n\\n**Out-of-Network Providers:**\\n- These providers do not have a contract with your insurance company, which usually means higher costs for you. If you choose to go out-of-network, you may have to pay a larger portion of the bill, or your insurance might not cover the service at all. If you do seek care from an out-of-network provider, it\\u2019s important to understand what your financial responsibility will be.\\n\\n**Filing Appeals:**\\nIf your insurance claim is denied, you have the right to request an independent external review. Be mindful of the time limits for filing these appeals\\u2014it&#x27;s vital to act promptly in challenging any denial of claims to ensure you get the benefits you deserve.\\n\\nRemember, keeping up-to-date with your healthcare plan details can save you money and help you make informed choices.

This means that simply naming them is not enough; you also need to ensure you have a clear guardian plan in your will.\\n\\n2. **Consistency Across Documents**: Aligning your beneficiaries with your will helps avoid confusion and potential legal disputes. If your will states one thing and your life insurance policy states another, it can complicate matters for your loved ones.\\n\\n3. **Life Changes**: Major life events\\u2014like your recent adoption\\u2014should prompt you to review and possibly update your life insurance coverage and beneficiary designations. Other events include marriage, divorce, or changes in financial situation.\\n\\n4. **Financial Planning**: As part of your long-term financial planning, regularly reviewing life insurance can help ensure that your coverage levels are adequate based on your family&#x27;s needs and any changes in circumstances.\\n\\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n- **How much life insurance do I actually need?**\\n  A common guideline suggests having 6-10 times your annual income, but this can vary based on your specific situation, including debts, number of dependents, and available financial resources. Consider what expenses your family would face and the income they would need for support.\\n\\n- **What\\u2019s the difference between basic life insurance and other types?**  \\n  Basic life insurance typically provides a straightforward death benefit but may lack options for additional coverage or investment components found in other types of policies like whole life or universal life insurance.\\n\\nIn summary, integrating your life insurance with your estate plan ensures that your financial legacy aligns with your familial and financial goals while protecting your loved ones effectively.","If your manager declines your reimbursement request for ergonomic office supplies, you can take the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Reason**: Ask your manager for specific business reasons behind the denial. This transparency can help you address any concerns they have.\\n\\n2. **Engage HR**: If you feel the denial was unfounded, you can discuss your situation with HR. They can provide additional guidance and support.\\n\\n3. **Request a Trial Period**: If there&#x27;s hesitation about remote work or the supplies you want, suggest a trial period. This allows you to demonstrate how these improvements can enhance your productivity.\\n\\nRemember, you are responsible for basic furniture and utilities, but your company does support ergonomic improvements and relevant supplies, so it&#x27;s worth advocating for what you need to work effectively!","Sure! Here\\u2019s a friendly explanation of the differences between basic life insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) coverage:\\n\\n### Basic Life Insurance:\\n- **What it covers:** This type of insurance pays out a full benefit to your beneficiaries regardless of how you pass away\\u2014natural causes, illness, or accidents.\\n- **Purpose:** It&#x27;s designed to help replace lost income and cover expenses for your family after your death, ensuring their financial security.\\n\\n### AD&amp;D Coverage:\\n- **What it covers:** AD&amp;D is more specific. It provides payment only if death or injuries result from an accident. If you pass away due to natural causes or illness, your AD&amp;D coverage won&#x27;t pay out.\\n- **Additional Benefits:** If you\\u2019re injured in an accident and lose a limb or sight, AD&amp;D also pays benefits for those specific injuries, even if they don\\u2019t result in death.\\n\\n### Beneficiary Considerations:\\n- You can name your minor children as beneficiaries, but it\\u2019s wise to also designate a guardian or set up a trust. This is important because minors can\\u2019t directly handle large sums of money, and a guardian can manage those funds responsibly.\\n- If you don\\u2019t name any beneficiaries, the insurance money will go to your estate, which can lead to delays, extra costs, and potential tax issues for your family. So, keeping your beneficiary designations updated is essential!\\n\\n### Summary:\\n- **Basic Life Insurance:** Covers all causes of death, ensuring financial support for your loved ones.\\n- **AD&amp;D Coverage:** Only pays for accidental deaths or injuries, with some additional benefits for specific injuries.\\n\\nBy understanding these two types of coverage, you can make informed decisions to help secure your children\\u2019s future.","Welcome back to work!

Keep in mind that wait times can differ, especially for infant care, which tends to be the longest.\\n\\n2. **Combining Benefits**: You can utilize multiple childcare benefits at the same time.
