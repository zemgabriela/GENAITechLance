It provides payment only if death or injuries result from an accident. If you pass away due to natural causes or illness, your AD&D coverage won't pay out.\n- **Additional Benefits:** If you’re injured in an accident and lose a limb or sight, AD&D also pays benefits for those specific injuries, even if they don’t result in death.\n\n### Beneficiary Considerations:\n- You can name your minor children as beneficiaries, but it’s wise to also designate a guardian or set up a trust. This is important because minors can’t directly handle large sums of money, and a guardian can manage those funds responsibly.\n- If you don’t name any beneficiaries, the insurance money will go to your estate, which can lead to delays, extra costs, and potential tax issues for your family.
