    "We start by creating the following functions: ```clean_text``` & ```load_files```. When looking at the given pdfs, we observe that the pdf is clean. There is no number of pages, images any extra context that should be removed. However we create a function that would lower the text, removes multiple spaces, etc. We decided not to get rid of punctions as they seem to be relevant. When it comes to the function ```load_files```, we assume that in the future the folder will be filled with other file extensions as well. Thus we create a generic function that would look at pdfs and other extensions as well."
